# Buffs
This repo is my first attempt at implementing control algorithms. Currently only uses PID as a positional control, still has some bugs to work out.

The majority of this project is focused on the simulation (Aerial_Device.py)
The unit tester script is how you can see the simulations inner workings and issues.
