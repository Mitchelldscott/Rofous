This Repository is meant for version control of a quadcopter controller. The two major
branches of development are computer vision and motor driving. The motor driver started
as a python notebook and transitioned into a c and h file. Due to the requirements of 
the computer vision development, a google colab notebook is used. The data for computer 
vision is in the data file.
